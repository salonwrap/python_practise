Below are details for the running the tests. I was not able to run on mobile or emulator as I was having problems with appium library in my automation environment. Test is running on Firefox web broweser

1.  Install python. Version used here is Python 3.7.3 

2.  Install robotframework
pip show robotframework --version
Name: robotframework
Version: 3.2.1

3.   Install robot selenimum library

Name: robotframework-seleniumlibrary
Version: 4.4.

4.  Install robot selenium2library (this I think is not needed, but I had it on my system and should not be an issue if it's not installed. Based on documentation selenium library overrides selenium2library)

Name: robotframework-selenium2library
Version: 3.0.0


Above install was done on mac and using pip.


5.  Install Pycharm CE. Version installed and tested with is 2020.1.2
